  Hello friends!

</h2>


My name is **Anna** and I am starting my career as a **QA engineer**.
I study testing in courses, on Youtube, I read books and articles. 
I also have some freelance testing experience. 

Before that, I worked in the Quality Control Department at a Pharmaceutical Factory, so I know exactly what quality is)))) <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/UQDSBzfyiBKvgFcSTw/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

In this repository, I want to introduce you to my practical skills of working with developer tools, databases through DBeaver, building applications through XCode, Android Studio, working with the emulator and simulator, and other frameworks and tools.
Above you can see the tools I work with and open them up to see exactly what I can do in each tool. 

In addition, I have experience in writing test documentation:
* [test cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140XrKajgcJM8wGsRxJvOFuAqLmJK8HrPqBH1z_xaYTA/edit#gid=0), 
* [checklists](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_MdUgzouo5qTSHpDNd00qjJgttb0aQpE5v_iu-uhEHw/edit#gid=0), 
* [use cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OHWExpiA8jet-IvHSe7KAhaB3dGisy3hiCB-rku4LPk/edit),

* checklists for testing [mobile](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11LLDmqRzOqTxpIAJjDG9UrgOACmXLQ2nBEpLJhSLA6I/edit#gid=0) apps. 
* checklist ([smoke](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqHT_iFtqoUyGLFhTzcXZO5Gu83yq7BPzaxPTdd7fT8/edit#gid=943491862), [critical path](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqHT_iFtqoUyGLFhTzcXZO5Gu83yq7BPzaxPTdd7fT8/edit#gid=0)) for the ToDoList app (which we covered in the course by Vadim Ksendzov).

I also have experience with Devtools ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pW5MeMp4wsZ9I3NSall5Tt905HltsiKL/view?usp=sharing))

I will update my repository as soon as I learn something new, to be continued....)
